## Weather Dashboard

As a user I want to search for the weather of a given city, so that I know how to plan for the day and week ahead. I would like to see the current weather for the day, and a 5 day future forecast. I would like to be able to view multiple elements including but not limited to: temperature, wind speed, UVI, and humidity.
